Uses of A/B testing
In the video, you saw how Electronic Arts used A/B testing on their website when launching SimCity 5. One version of the page showed an advertisement for a discount, and one version did not. Half the users saw one version of the page, and the other half saw the second version of the page.

What is the main reason to use an A/B test?

It provides a way to check outcomes of competing scenarios and decide which way to proceed.


Print the late_shipments dataset.
Calculate the proportion of late shipments in the sample; that is, the mean cases where the late column is "Yes".

# Print the late_shipments dataset
print(late_shipments)

# Calculate the proportion of late shipments
late_prop_samp = (late_shipments['late']=='Yes').mean()

# Print the results
print(late_prop_samp)


Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%.
Calculate the standard error from the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution.
Calculate the z-score.

# Hypothesize that the proportion is 6%
late_prop_hyp = 0.06


# Calculate the standard error
std_error = np.std(late_shipments_boot_distn, ddof=1)

# Find z-score of late_prop_samp
z_score = (late_prop_samp - late_prop_hyp) / std_error

# Print z_score
print(z_score)


Calculate the z-score of late_prop_samp.
Calculate the p-value for the z-score, using a right-tailed test.

# Calculate the z-score of late_prop_samp
z_score = (late_prop_samp - late_prop_hyp) / std_error

# Calculate the p-value
p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(z_score)
                 
# Print the p-value
print(p_value) 


Calculate a 95% confidence interval from late_shipments_boot_distn using the quantile method, labeling the lower and upper intervals lower and upper.

# Calculate 95% confidence interval using quantile method
lower = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.025)
upper = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.975)

# Print the confidence interval
print((lower, upper))
